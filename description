Title: Equivalence notions on labelled transitions systems
Author: Solange Coupet-Grimal
Institution: Laboratoire d'Informatique de Marseille   
Description:
We give the specification of three different notions of equivalence
classically defined on labelled transitions systems underlying the
theories of process algebra (and particularly CCS). The fundamentals
properties of these equivalence notions are proven.
