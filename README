The file trans_sys.v contains the specifications of the three different
notions of equivalence classically defined on labelled transitions systems, 
underlying the theories of process algebra (and particularly CCS), as well as 
the proofs of their fundamentals properties.

The section is parameterized with the set of states "process",
the set of labels "action" and the transition relation "transition". 
A particular action "T" stands for the silent action of process algebra. 
We suppose that the predicate defined on "action"  by  "to be equal to T" 
is decidable.

"derivative" and "weak_derivative " corresponds to the two notions of
derivatives introduced by Milner in the chapter 7 of the book 
"A Calculus of Communicating Systems" (Prentice Hall).

"strong_eq", "weak_eq", "obs_eq" respectively denote the strong equivalence, 
the weak equivalence and the observational equivalence.

In order to prove that these relations are equivalence relations, we 
introduce the relation "weak_eq1" that is proven to be equivalent to "weak_eq"
and the relation  "obs_eq1" that is proven to be equivalent to "obs_eq".

Then, we prove that "strong_eq" is stronger than "obs_eq" and that "obs_eq" 
is stronger than "weak_eq".

A research report with more details will be available soon.
